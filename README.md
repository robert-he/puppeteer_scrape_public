The mini-project scrapes the Mioym webpage and does several things: 

 1. Creates a pdf of the contents on the Mioym Website 'News' section and saves it as 'full-page-pdf' in the directory.
 2. Takes a screenshot of the contents of the Mioym Website 'New' section and saves it as a .png
 3. Scrapes the Mioym Website 'Team' section for photo, link to bio, name, and title of all team members and saves it as JSON data into the file 'team_members.json'
